# Arcane Client Cosmetics System

First iteration of the Arcane Client Cosmetics system that gives everyone a single cape, and set of wings. This also works with 000webhost.

---

## Information

*This system is used by Arcane Client 1.7.10, which is a reskin of CheatBreaker, and in no way has anything to do with CheatBreaker LLC, FrozenOrb LLC, or Hylist Games or the Arcane Network.*

This was intended to be cleaned up and perfected, however was never done.

---

## Usage

`Notice: THE CAPE AND WINGS MUST BE IN THE CLIENT ITSELF, IF IT IS NOT IT WILL RETURN AN INVALID TEXTURE.`

When applying the link, make sure your link points directly to the .php file, and it has to have "?uuid=" on the end of it.

Your API link should look like this, provided you use 000webhost: http://sitename.000webhostapp.com/cosmetics.php?uuid=

If you are a VPS or some other type of file hosting, your API link should look like this: http://domainname.com/cosmetics.php?uuid=

*NOTE: THE "?uuid=" PART IS REQUIRED TO GIVE COSMETICS, WITHOUT IT THE COSMETICS API WILL NOT WORK.*
