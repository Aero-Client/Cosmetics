<h2 align="center">First iteration of the Aero Client Cosmetics system that gives everyone a single cape, and set of wings. This also works with 000webhost.</h2> 

<h4 align="center">This system was made so that websockets were not required to be used, so therefore this system will not work on any version that requires websockets to be used, it will only work on version 1.5 or lower, we recommend using CheatBreaker Plain for this system, which has no bugs at all, and supports this cosmetics system. <br> CheatBreaker Plain link: https://mega.nz/#!wggCTCyC!T8-bDpG6wTSX1vJ9oUdRNEYjd-wItIeGDDsMwCAAWG8</h4>

# Information

*This system was used by Aero Client 1.7.10, which is a reskin of CheatBreaker, and in no way has anything to do with CheatBreaker LLC, or FrozenOrb LLC.*

<h4>This was intended to be cleaned up and perfected, however was never done as it was a soft release, and only used for beta testing.</h4>

---

# Usage

<h4>Make sure the cosmetics that you are trying to apply to everyone is in the client's capes folder, once you've confirmed it is, for the "resourceLocation", put the cape's file name, you do not need to put the file extension.</h4>

<h4>When applying the link, make sure your link points directly to the .php file, and it has to have "?uuid=" on the end of it.</h4>
<h4>If you use 000webhost, your API link should look like this: http://sitename.000webhostapp.com/cosmetics.php?uuid=</h4>
<h4>If you are using a VPS or some other type of file hosting, your API link should look like this: http://domainname.com/cosmetics.php?uuid=</h4>

*NOTE: THE "?uuid=" PART IS REQUIRED TO GIVE COSMETICS, WITHOUT IT THE COSMETICS API WILL NOT WORK.*
